Zoom Bingo Night Vegas Slots is a variant of the classic casino game bingo. Instead of marking off numbers on a paper card, players in Zoom Bingo Night Vegas Slots use slots machines to win prizes. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, which are divided into four suits (clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds). The aim of the game is to collect as many card points as possible by winning prizes on the slots machines.

The player with the most card points at the end of the game wins! To play Zoom Bingo Night Vegas Slots, first decide how many cards you want to play (between one and six). You can then choose to bet between one and three coins on each card. Once you have made your bets, press the ‘deal’ button to receive your cards.

You will then be dealt five cards, face up. The dealer will also reveal one card, face up. This is your ‘zoom’ card and will give you an extra bonus if matched in your hand. Win prizes by matching symbols on the slots machines – three in a row pays out the biggest prize. If you don’t like any of your cards, press the ‘draw’ button and you will be dealt new ones.

When all of your cards have been played, add up your points to see if you have won! The payout table shows how many points are awarded for each symbol combination. In Zoom Bingo Night Vegas Slots, some symbols are more valuable than others – watch out for diamonds! So put on your gambling hat and head to the nearest casino – it’s time to play Zoom Bingo Night Vegas Slots!
