#  Seahawks Looking to Cover in Week 10 Against the Falcons 

The Seattle Seahawks will be looking to cover the spread when they take on the Atlanta Falcons in Week 10. The Falcons are favored by 5.5 points, but the Seahawks have been playing well lately and should be able to keep it close.

Seattle comes into this game with a 5-3 record, while Atlanta is 4-4. The Seahawks have been impressive on offense this season, averaging nearly 26 points per game. Russell Wilson has been one of the NFL's best quarterbacks this year, and he will be looking to lead his team to a victory over the Falcons.

Atlanta has had its share of problems this season, but the offense has been good enough to win most games. The Falcons are led by quarterback Matt Ryan, who is having another solid season. He will be looking to exploit Seattle's defense and pick up an easy win on Sunday.

Both of these teams are capable of winning this game, but I think Seattle is the more complete team. The Seahawks should be able to keep it close and possibly pull off an upset victory.

#  Wilson, Baldwin Lead Seahawks to 37-31 Victory Over Falcons in Week 10 

Russell Wilson and Doug Baldwin led the Seattle Seahawks to a last-minute 37-31 victory over the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday at CenturyLink Field. Seattle (6-3) erased a 14-point deficit in the fourth quarter to improve to 4-0 at home this season.

Wilson completed 23 of 32 passes for 309 yards and two touchdowns, including the game-winner to Baldwin with 31 seconds left. Baldwin had seven receptions for 126 yards and two scores.

Atlanta (4-5) jumped out to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, taking advantage of a pair of Seahawks turnovers, but Seattle rallied to take a 17-14 halftime lead. The Falcons recaptured the lead in the third quarter on Matt Ryanâ€™s 11-yard touchdown pass to Taylor Gabriel, but Seattle scored the final 14 points of the game.

Ryan completed 36 of 45 passes for 317 yards and three touchdowns for Atlanta. Julio Jones had 11 receptions for 128 yards and a touchdown, and Devonta Freeman ran for 84 yards and two scores.

#  Seahawks Hope to Continue Momentum with road Game Against Jets 

The Seattle Seahawks are coming off of a huge road win against the Denver Broncos. They will now look to continue their momentum with a road game against the New York Jets.

The Seahawks have been playing very well lately, thanks in part to their strong defense. They held the high-powered Broncos offense to just 12 points, while also rushing for 201 yards as a team.

Russell Wilson had another good game, passing for 312 yards and two touchdowns. He will need to continue playing well if the Seahawks want to beat the Jets.

The Jets are coming off of a loss to the Miami Dolphins. They were held to just three points in that game, with Ryan Fitzpatrick throwing for 164 yards and no touchdowns.

The Jets have not been very good this season, so the Seahawks should be able to win this game if they play well. However, it won't be easy, and they cannot take the Jets lightly.

#  Seattle Looks to Stay Perfect at Home in Matchup Against Panthers 

Since 2001, the Seattle Seahawks have only lost six home games in the regular season. On Sunday, they'll look to add to that total as they face the Carolina Panthers.

The Seahawks come into this matchup with a perfect 4-0 record at home. In their two most recent games at CenturyLink Field, they beat the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers by a combined score of 71-16.

Russell Wilson has been playing extremely well this season, and he will be looking to continue that trend against the Panthers. In his last three games, Wilson has thrown for 9 touchdowns and zero interceptions. He has also rushed for 2 touchdowns in that span.

The Panthers come into this game with a 2-3 record, but they have played some tough opponents thus far. In their last game, they lost to the Philadelphia Eagles by a score of 28-23. Cam Newton had an off day in that contest, completing only 54% of his passes for 201 yards and 1 touchdown.

It is unclear whether or not Newton will be able to play in this game due to an injury he suffered last week. If he is unable to go, backup quarterback Derek Anderson will get the start.

The Seahawks are favored by 6 points in this game, and they should be able to come away with a victory.

#  Seahawks Eye Third Straight Win as They Take on Rams

The Seattle Seahawks (2-1) will look to win their third consecutive game on Sunday as they take on the Los Angeles Rams (2-1).

Seattle is coming off of a 29-3 win over the Dallas Cowboys in Week 3, while Los Angeles is coming off of a 35-23 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

The Seahawks have been led offensively by Russell Wilson, who has completed 66.7 percent of his passes for 842 yards, eight touchdowns, and one interception this season.

On the other side of the ball, Seattle's defense has been dominant, allowing an average of just 12.7 points per game.

Los Angeles has been led offensively by Jared Goff, who has completed 66.7 percent of his passes for 842 yards, eight touchdowns, and one interception this season.

However, the Rams' defense has been less than stellar, allowing an average of 27 points per game.
