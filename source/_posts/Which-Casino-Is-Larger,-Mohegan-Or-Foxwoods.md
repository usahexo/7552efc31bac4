#  Who Has The Largest Casino - Mohegan or Foxwoods?

If you are someone who likes to gamble, then you may be wondering who has the largest casino - Mohegan or Foxwoods? The answer to this question is not as straightforward as you might think.

The Foxwoods Resort Casino is the biggest casino in the world, according to Guinness World Records. It covers an impressive 400,000 square feet and features over 6,500 slot machines and 340 gaming tables.

However, when it comes to the size of their actual buildings, the Mohegan Sun Casino is actually larger. The Mohegan Sun Casino covers a total of 1.5 million square feet, compared to Foxwoods' 400,000 square feet. So, if you are looking for the biggest and most impressive casino building, then the Mohegan Sun Casino is the winner.

# Who Has The Largest Gambling Market - Connecticut or Nevada?

In terms of gambling market size, Connecticut is actually far larger than Nevada. According to a report from 2016, Connecticut's gambling market was worth $2.5 billion, while Nevada's was worth just $1.4 billion.

This is largely due to the fact that Connecticut has a much larger population than Nevada.

So, if you are looking for a state with the largest gambling market overall, then Nevada would be your best bet.
