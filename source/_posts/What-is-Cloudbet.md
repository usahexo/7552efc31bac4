#  How do I bet using Cloudbet?

Cloudbet is a bitcoin sportsbook and casino that allows customers to bet in bitcoins. Cloudbet has a comprehensive guide on how to make a deposit, but this article will specifically focus on how to make a bet.

To make a bet, first navigate to the sport or market you wish to wager on. Once you have found the event you want to bet on, click the odds next to the selection you want. This will change the betting slip on the right-hand side of the page to show your selected bet.

Now enter your stake into the "Stake" field, and then click "Place Bet". The bet will now be placed and appear in My Bets. You can track the progress of your bet under "My Bets".

If your selection wins, your payout (minus our commission) will automatically be credited to your account balance immediately after the event concludes. For example, if you wagered 1 bitcoin and your selection won, you would receive 0.99 bitcoin credited to your account balance.
