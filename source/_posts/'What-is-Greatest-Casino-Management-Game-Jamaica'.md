#  Playing the Odds: The Best Casino Games in Jamaica 

In a country where gambling is as popular as playing reggae music, picking the right casino game in Jamaica can be daunting. However, with a little bit of knowledge, you can make an informed decision and start enjoying some of the best casino games that the island has to offer.

Before getting into the specific games that you can find at Jamaican casinos, it’s important to understand the different types of wagers that are available. The three most common types of bets are called ‘inside bets’, ‘outside bets’ and ‘parlay bets’.

Inside bets are placed on specific numbers or groups of numbers, whereas outside bets are placed on whether the ball will land on a red or black number, whether it will be odd or even, and which half of the wheel the ball will end up in. Parlay bets are a combination of both inside and outside bets.

Now that you know the basics, let’s take a look at some of the best casino games in Jamaica. 


Roulette is one of the most popular casino games in Jamaica and is played on a wheel with 36 numbered slots: 18 red and 18 black. Players bet on what number or group of numbers they think the ball will end up in after spinning around the wheel. There is also a green slot labelled 0-36 which is where players can place their outside bets. 


 Blackjack is another classic casino game that is loved by players all over the world. In blackjack, each player is dealt two cards and tries to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The dealer also has two cards, but must always hit if they have 16 or less and stand if they have 17 or more. This makes for exciting gameplay as players need to keep track of both their cards and those of the dealer in order to make smart decisions about when to hit or stand. 

Craps is another popular dice game that can be found in Jamaican casinos. Players wager on whether they think that particular roll of the dice (two six-sided dice) will be high (7, 8 or 9) or low (2, 3 or 12). There are a variety of other wagers available too, so craps can seem quite complex at first glance but it’s definitely worth giving it a go! 

Finally, we have slots which are very popular among casino gamers everywhere! In slots, players put money into one or more machines and then spin reels in an attempt to match symbols across any one of several paylines in order to win cash prizes. There are many different themes available in slots games nowadays so there’s sure to be something for everyone.
