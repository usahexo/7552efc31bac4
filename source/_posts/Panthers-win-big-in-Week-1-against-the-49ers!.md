#  Panthers win big in Week 1 against the 49ers!

There was a lot of excitement in the air as the Carolina Panthers kicked off their season against the San Francisco 49ers. The Panthers didn't disappoint, blowing out the 49ers 46-27.

The offense was firing on all cylinders, with Cam Newton throwing for three touchdowns and 288 yards. Christian McCaffrey also had a big game, rushing for 102 yards and two touchdowns.

The defense was dominant as well, holding the 49ers to just 276 total yards and forcing three turnovers. Rookie cornerback Donte Jackson had an impressive debut, intercepting a pass and returning it for a touchdown.

All in all, it was a great way for the Panthers to start the season. They'll look to keep the momentum going next week against the Atlanta Falcons.

#  Newton and company poised for a Super Bowl run in 2017!

For the first time in a few years, the Carolina Panthers have a realistic chance to make a Super Bowl run. With the return of quarterback Cam Newton and his top target Kelvin Benjamin from injuries, as well as an underrated defense, this team is poised to make some noise in the NFC.

The Panthers started their offseason by signing veteran guard Andrew Norwell to a lucrative deal, solidifying one of their weakest positions. They also drafted dynamic running back Christian McCaffrey with the 8th overall pick, adding another playmaker to an already stacked offense.

While they may not have taken home the Lombardi trophy last year, the Panthers were one of the most dominant teams in the NFL until their Super Bowl 50 loss to the Denver Broncos. With Newton and company healthy and hungry for redemption, there’s no reason they can’t make a run at the title in 2017.

#  Panthers trounce the Seahawks to stay undefeated!

In a matchup of two unbeaten teams, the Carolina Panthers came out on top, trouncing the Seattle Seahawks 27-3. The Panthers defense was stifling, holding the Seahawks to just 176 yards of total offense.

Panthers quarterback Cam Newton had an efficient day, completing 15 of his 21 passes for 215 yards and 2 touchdowns. Wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin was once again Newton's favorite target, catching 7 passes for 109 yards and a touchdown.

The Seahawks lone touchdown came late in the game, when Russell Wilson connected with wide receiver Doug Baldwin for a 26-yard score.

With the win, the Panthers remain undefeated and atop the NFC South standings.

#  Huge comeback victory against the Patriots leaves Panthers at 5-0!

The Carolina Panthers were in for a fight on Sunday as they faced the undefeated New England Patriots. Many people picked the Patriots to win, but the Panthers proved that they are a force to be reckoned with by dominating from start to finish and winning 41-17.

This was a huge victory for the Panthers and it leaves them at 5-0 for the season. They have now won nine consecutive games dating back to last season, which is the longest active win streak in the NFL.

It was clear from the start that the Panthers were going to win this game. They took an early 21-3 lead and never looked back. Cam Newton played an impressive game, completing 25 of his 33 passes for 316 yards and three touchdowns. Kelvin Benjamin also had a big day, catching eight passes for 117 yards and two touchdowns.

The Patriots were never able to get anything going on offense, and their defense was gashed by Newton and Benjamin throughout the game. This was a very disappointing performance by New England, who came into this game with high expectations.

Now that Carolina has shown that they can beat one of the best teams in the NFL, they will be even more dangerous as the season progresses. They have already beaten three teams who made it to the playoffs last year, so there is no doubt that they are one of the top contenders in the league this year.

If Carolina can stay healthy and continue playing like they have been, there is no reason why they can't make it all the way to Super Bowl 50.
