      		<h1 id="1XBET-Opens-Doors-for-NJ-Sports-Bettors"><a href="#1XBET-Opens-Doors-for-NJ-Sports-Bettors" class="headerlink" title="1XBET Opens Doors for NJ Sports Bettors"></a>1XBET Opens Doors for NJ Sports Bettors</h1><p>Online sports betting fans in New Jersey have a new, licensed destination to enjoy their favorite pastime, as 1XBET has recently opened its virtual doors to customers in the Garden State.</p>
<p>This move by 1XBET makes the site the latest in a growing number of offshore betting providers to enter into the New Jersey market, following in the footsteps of industry giants such as FanDuel and DraftKings.</p>
<p>1XBET is well known for its expansive variety of betting markets, offering odds on everything from mainstream sports such as football and basketball, to more niche events such as e-sports and darts. In addition, the site offers a comprehensive live betting service that allows customers to bet on in-game action as it unfolds.</p>
<p>1XBET is licensed by the government of Curacao and is regulated by the Curacao Gaming Commission. This ensures that all customer funds are held in segregated accounts, and that games are fair and random.</p>
<p>In order to welcome new customers in New Jersey, 1XBET is offering a 100% match bonus on first deposits up to $100. This bonus can be used to place bets on any event offered by the site.</p>
<h1 id="1XBET-Brings-Sports-Betting-to-New-Jersey"><a href="#1XBET-Brings-Sports-Betting-to-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="1XBET Brings Sports Betting to New Jersey"></a>1XBET Brings Sports Betting to New Jersey</h1><p>On July 11, 1XBET announced that it had obtained a license to offer sports betting in New Jersey. The move makes 1XBET the latest online sportsbook to enter the US market, following in the footsteps of operators such as DraftKings and FanDuel.</p>
<p>1XBET is already well-known in Europe as a leading online sportsbook and casino operator. The company has been operating for over a decade and currently has over 1 million customers. In addition to its core sports betting product, 1XBET also offers a comprehensive casino offering, including slots, table games, and live dealers.</p>
<p>1XBET’s launch in New Jersey represents an important step in the company’s global expansion strategy. The US market is one of the largest and most mature gaming markets in the world, and offers significant potential for growth.</p>
<p>1XBET is initially launching its sports betting product in New Jersey through a partnership with Resorts Casino Hotel. This will give 1XBET access to Resorts’ well-established customer base and provide a valuable foothold in the New Jersey market.</p>
<p>In addition to its partnership with Resorts Casino Hotel, 1XBET is also partnering with Hard Rock Atlantic City Hotel &amp; Casino. This will provide 1XBET with a presence at two of the most prominent casinos in New Jersey.</p>
<p>1XBET is planning to offer both a desktop and mobile version of its sports betting product in New Jersey. The desktop version will be available through the company’s website, while the mobile version will be available through dedicated apps for iOS and Android devices.</p>
<p>1XBET plans to offer a wide range of betting options on both local and international sporting events. In addition to traditional sporting events such as football, basketball, and baseball, 1XBET will also offer bets on more niche events such as bandy (a type of ice hockey) and surfing competitions.</p>
<p>The launch of 1XBET’s sports betting product in New Jersey represents an important milestone for the company. With its strong brand name and experience in the online gambling industry, 1XBET is well positioned to succeed in this rapidly growing market.</p>
