      		<h1 id="Gaming-Company-Valve-Bans-Popular-Game-for-Allegedly-Copying-Dota-2"><a href="#Gaming-Company-Valve-Bans-Popular-Game-for-Allegedly-Copying-Dota-2" class="headerlink" title="Gaming Company Valve Bans Popular Game for Allegedly Copying Dota 2"></a>Gaming Company Valve Bans Popular Game for Allegedly Copying Dota 2</h1><p>In a surprising turn of events, gaming company Valve has announced that it is banning the popular game “Fortnite” for allegedly copying its game “Dota 2.”</p>
<p>In a statement released on the company’s website, Valve explained that it made the decision to ban Fortnite after discovering that the game blatantly copies Dota 2 in terms of art style, gameplay, and mechanics.</p>
<p>According to Valve, Epic Games, the developers of Fortnite, had access to Dota 2 data for years and used it to create their own game. This is evidenced by the fact that many of Fortnite’s features are identical to those found in Dota 2.</p>
<p>Epic Games has yet to comment on Valve’s announcement, but it is likely that they will release a statement soon.</p>
<p>The news of Fortnite’s ban has caused shockwaves throughout the gaming community, with many people criticizing Valve for making such a drastic decision. Some gamers have even accused Valve of being jealous of Epic Games’ success and trying to sabotage them.</p>
<p>However, Valve has stated that its decision to ban Fortnite was not based on jealousy or spite, but rather on the belief that developers must respect intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Valve also clarified that it is not interested in preventing other games from being made, but simply wants other developers to be more mindful when borrowing ideas from other games.</p>
<h1 id="Valve-Responds-to-Claims-of-Copyright-Infringement-by-Banning-Imperial-Dragon-Game"><a href="#Valve-Responds-to-Claims-of-Copyright-Infringement-by-Banning-Imperial-Dragon-Game" class="headerlink" title="Valve Responds to Claims of Copyright Infringement by Banning Imperial Dragon Game"></a>Valve Responds to Claims of Copyright Infringement by Banning Imperial Dragon Game</h1><p>In a statement released earlier today, Valve Corporation announced that they have banned the game Imperial Dragon from their online gaming service, Steam, due to allegations of copyright infringement.</p>
<p>The game’s developer, Blackfire Games, has been accused of copying art and assets from Blizzard’s hit game, StarCraft II. In particular, Blackfire has been accused of using character models and textures from the game without permission.</p>
<p>Blizzard filed a DMCA takedown notice against Blackfire Games last week, leading to the removal of Imperial Dragon from Steam. However, Blackfire has denied any wrongdoing, stating that they created the game independently and did not copy any content from StarCraft II.</p>
<p>Valve has not given a specific reason for why they chose to ban Imperial Dragon from their service. However, it is likely that they believe that the game infringes on Blizzard’s copyright rights. This is the first time that Valve has taken such action against a game developer.</p>
<p>In a statement released to Kotaku, a spokesperson for Valve said “Imperial Dragon was removed from Steam because it included unauthorized copies of copyrighted materials owned by Blizzard Entertainment.”</p>
<p>Blackfire Games has not yet commented on Valve’s decision to ban their game.</p>
<h1 id="Popular-Indie-Game-Banned-by-Valve-for-Allegedly-Copying-Dota-2"><a href="#Popular-Indie-Game-Banned-by-Valve-for-Allegedly-Copying-Dota-2" class="headerlink" title="Popular Indie Game Banned by Valve for Allegedly Copying Dota 2"></a>Popular Indie Game Banned by Valve for Allegedly Copying Dota 2</h1><p>One of the most popular indie games on Steam, “Battlerite,” has been removed from sale by Valve Corp. after allegations surfaced that the game was a copy of Valve’s popular MOBA title, Dota 2.</p>
<p>The move comes as a surprise to many in the gaming community, as Battlerite has been one of the most successful independently developed games on Steam, and is still being played by hundreds of thousands of users.</p>
<p>In a statement released by Valve, the company said that it was their “duty to protect the intellectual property of other developers.”</p>
<p>“Battlerite is a blatant copy of Dota 2 and we will not allow it to be sold on Steam,” the statement read. “We have notified Battlerite’s developer that they must remove the game from sale or we will take further action.”</p>
<p>The developer of Battlerite, Stunlock Studios, has yet to comment on the allegations or Valve’s statement.</p>
<h1 id="Indie-Developer-Responds-to-Valve’s-Banning-of-Imperial-Dragon-Game"><a href="#Indie-Developer-Responds-to-Valve’s-Banning-of-Imperial-Dragon-Game" class="headerlink" title="Indie Developer Responds to Valve’s Banning of Imperial Dragon Game"></a>Indie Developer Responds to Valve’s Banning of Imperial Dragon Game</h1><p>A little over a week ago, Valve implemented a change to their Steamworks policy, barring developers from using the service if their game contains “any content that is illegal, or violates the rights of any third party.” This change came as a surprise to many small-time developers who rely on Steam for distribution.</p>
<p>One such developer is Jameson Lian, creator of the indie game Imperial Dragon. In an e-mail to Gamasutra, Lian stated that he was “pretty disappointed” in Valve’s decision.</p>
<p>He continued: “I understand that they want to keep their service family friendly, but games like Imperial Dragon are hardly objectionable. It’s just a silly little game about running around and stabbing things.”</p>
<p>Lian isn’t the only one upset by Valve’s policy change. Many developers have taken to social media and forums to express their dissatisfaction. Some have even threatened to abandon Steam altogether.</p>
<p>In response to the outcry, Valve has issued a statement defending their new policy. The company says that they are “not interested in supporting trading cards or achievements for games that don’t adhere to our standards for content.”</p>
<p>While some developers may not be happy with Valve’s new stance, it is unlikely that they will abandon the world’s largest digital distribution platform. Steam currently has over 125 million active users and offers devs a number of advantages, including easy access to features like leaderboards and cloud saves.</p>
<h1 id="Valve’s-Banning-of-Imperial-Dragon-Game-Sparks-Debate-Among-Gamers"><a href="#Valve’s-Banning-of-Imperial-Dragon-Game-Sparks-Debate-Among-Gamers" class="headerlink" title="Valve’s Banning of Imperial Dragon Game Sparks Debate Among Gamers"></a>Valve’s Banning of Imperial Dragon Game Sparks Debate Among Gamers</h1><p>The popular video game distribution platform Steam has come under scrutiny from gamers after it removed the game Imperial Dragon from its store. The game, which is a 2D sidescrolling beat ‘em up, was banned for unclear reasons, sparking a heated debate among gamers about what should and should not be allowed on the platform.</p>
<p>Some gamers argue that Valve is arbitrarily censoring content and that there is no clear reason why Imperial Dragon was removed. They argue that the game is not particularly offensive or obscene and that it simply provides a fun gaming experience. Others argue that Valve has the right to remove any game they want from their platform and that there must be a reason why they chose to ban Imperial Dragon.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is not the first time that Valve has removed a game from its store for unknown reasons. Last year, they removed the party game Party Panic without any explanation. This has left many gamers feeling frustrated and confused as to why their favorite games are being removed without any explanation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it seems that Valve’s actions have sparked more questions than answers among gamers. While some people are arguing for more censorship, others are calling for Valve to be more transparent about their decisions regarding which games are allowed on their platform. Only time will tell if Valve decides to clarify their position on censorship or whether this issue will continue to cause tension among gamers.</p>
