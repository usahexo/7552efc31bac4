<h1 id="Gold-Strike-Casino-offers-players-a-new-bonus-poker-game"><a href="#Gold-Strike-Casino-offers-players-a-new-bonus-poker-game" class="headerlink" title="Gold Strike Casino offers players a new bonus poker game"></a>Gold Strike Casino offers players a new bonus poker game</h1><p>Gold Strike Casino has recently introduced a new bonus poker game that offers players the chance to win big prizes. The game is called Bonus Poker Deluxe, and it features four different bonus rounds that can payout big money.</p>
<p>The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, and the player is dealt five cards. The goal is to create the best possible hand using two of the player’s cards and three of the community cards. The player may discard up to two of their original five cards and replace them with new ones from the deck.</p>
<p>Once all players have placed their bets, the dealer begins dealing out the cards. The first card is placed face-up in the middle of the table, and the second card is placed face-down next to it. The face-up card is turned over, and this becomes the first community card. The next three community cards are then turned over one at a time.</p>
<p>After all the community cards are revealed, each player compares their hand against the dealer’s hand. If the player has a higher hand than the dealer, they win even money on their bet plus a bonus payout depending on the rank of their hand. If the player has a lower hand than the dealer, they lose their bet.</p>
<p>Bonus Poker Deluxe features four different bonus rounds that can payout big money. These bonuses are triggered when specific combinations of cards are dealt to the player. The first bonus is called “Double Double Bonus”, and it pays out 125 times your bet if you get four Aces with a kicker or two pair). The second bonus is called “Triple Double Bonus”, and it pays out 400 times your bet if you get four Aces without a kicker or three of a kind). The third bonus is called “Four of a Kind”, and it pays out 1000 times your bet if you get four of a kind. The fourth bonus is called “Royal Flush”, and it pays out 4000 times your bet if you get a royal flush.</p>
<p>Bonus Poker Deluxe is an exciting new game that offers players the chance to win big prizes. With four different bonuses that can payout up to 4000 times your bet, there is plenty of opportunity for excitement and prize money!</p>
