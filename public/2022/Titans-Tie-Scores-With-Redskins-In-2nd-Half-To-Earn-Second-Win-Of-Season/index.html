            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Titans-Tie-Scores-With-Redskins-In-2nd-Half-To-Earn-Second-Win-Of-Season"><a href="#Titans-Tie-Scores-With-Redskins-In-2nd-Half-To-Earn-Second-Win-Of-Season" class="headerlink" title="Titans Tie Scores With Redskins In 2nd Half To Earn Second Win Of Season"></a>Titans Tie Scores With Redskins In 2nd Half To Earn Second Win Of Season</h1><p>In a game that came down to the wire, the Tennessee Titans were able to tie the score against Washington Redskins and send the game into overtime. This was their second win of the season, and it was a very exciting game to watch.</p>
<p>The first half was all Redskins, as they were able to score two touchdowns and keep the Titans from scoring any points at all. However, in the second half, things changed. The Titans were finally able to get on the scoreboard with a touchdown in the third quarter. This seemed to fire them up, and they were able to tie up the score in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Overtime was a back-and-forth battle, but ultimately it was the Titans who emerged victorious. This is an important win for them as they continue to try and make a comeback in their season. They will now have some time to rest before their next game, which will be against the Indianapolis Colts.</p>
<h1 id="Mariota-Leads-Titans-To-Another-Victory-Now-4-1-This-Season"><a href="#Mariota-Leads-Titans-To-Another-Victory-Now-4-1-This-Season" class="headerlink" title="Mariota Leads Titans To Another Victory; Now 4-1 This Season"></a>Mariota Leads Titans To Another Victory; Now 4-1 This Season</h1><p>Marcus Mariota had himself an outing on Sunday, throwing for 270 yards and two touchdowns as the Tennessee Titans downed the Philadelphia Eagles 26-23.</p>
<p>This marked the fourth victory of the season for Mariota and the Titans (4-1), who continue to look like one of the surprise teams in the league.</p>
<p>Philadelphia actually had a chance to win it at the end, but failed to convert on a 4th-and-1 from their own 38-yard line with just over two minutes to play.</p>
<p>That set up Mariota’s game-winning TD pass to Corey Davis with six seconds left.</p>
<p>“It feels good,” Mariota said after the game. “It was a great team effort. We struggled in some areas, but we found a way to win.”</p>
<p>Mariota has now thrown for at least two touchdowns in each of his last four games.</p>
<p>  The Titans will look to keep things going when they host the Baltimore Ravens in Week 6.</p>
<h1 id="Titans-Turn-Things-Around-In-Second-Half-To-Earn-Fourth-Win-In-Last-Six-Games"><a href="#Titans-Turn-Things-Around-In-Second-Half-To-Earn-Fourth-Win-In-Last-Six-Games" class="headerlink" title="Titans Turn Things Around In Second Half To Earn Fourth Win In Last Six Games"></a>Titans Turn Things Around In Second Half To Earn Fourth Win In Last Six Games</h1><p>The Tennessee Titans were glad to have the bye week come at the right time. It certainly appeared that way after they put together a much better performance in the second half to earn their fourth win in the past six games, 20-13 over the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>
<p>Marcus Mariota completed 15 of his 24 passes for 159 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception. Derrick Henry scored twice on short runs, while Antonio Andrews had a team-high 51 receiving yards on four catches.</p>
<p>The defense was led by Jurrell Casey with eight tackles and two sacks. Brian Orakpo had 1.5 sacks, Wesley Woodyard had seven tackles and an interception, and Jason McCourty added six tackles and a pass breakup.</p>
<p>The Titans (5-6) took the lead early in the third quarter on Mariota’s 4-yard touchdown pass to Harry Douglas and never looked back. Jacksonville (2-9) managed just two field goals over the final three quarters. The first was set up by Dante Fowler Jr’s interception of Mariota late in the first half, but McCourty stripped Fowler Jr. of the ball deep in Titans territory on Jacksonville’s next possession to thwart any chance at a comeback.</p>
<p>It was just the latest example of how Tennessee has been playing much better football as of late despite having a losing record. “We knew what kind of game it was going to be,” Casey said. “We knew it was going to be hard fought all four quarters. We just had to keep pushing and eventually we would pull away from them. That’s what we did today.”</p>
<p>With four games left in the season, starting with Sunday’s game against Oakland (7-3), the Titans can still make a run at the playoffs – if they can continue to play like they have been recently. “I think guys are starting to believe,” coach Mike Mularkey said. “I saw it in their eyes this week – not only defensively but offensively – that they believed they could win this game. And I thought that showed up in how we played today both offensively and defensively for most of the game.”</p>
<h1 id="Henry-Davis-Lead-Titans-Over-Redskins-Franchise-Rushing-Duo-Ties-NFL-Record"><a href="#Henry-Davis-Lead-Titans-Over-Redskins-Franchise-Rushing-Duo-Ties-NFL-Record" class="headerlink" title="Henry, Davis Lead Titans Over Redskins; Franchise Rushing Duo Ties NFL Record"></a>Henry, Davis Lead Titans Over Redskins; Franchise Rushing Duo Ties NFL Record</h1><p>The Tennessee Titans became the latest team to beat the Washington Redskins with a 33-16 victory on Sunday at Nissan Stadium. Derrick Henry rushed for 149 yards and two touchdowns on 19 carries, while Dion Lewis had 95 yards and one touchdown on 16 carries. The Titans (5-5) have now amassed 1,044 rushing yards as a team this season, tying the NFL record set by the Denver Broncos in 2000.</p>
<p>“It feels great,” said Henry after the game. “To be able to do it with my teammate, Dion, is amazing. We just want to keep winning games.”</p>
<p>The Redskins (6-4) entered the game as one of the top defenses in the league against the run, but they were no match for Henry and Lewis. Washington had allowed just three teams to rush for more than 100 yards this season, but Henry and Lewis both topped that mark on Sunday.</p>
<p>Washington quarterback Alex Smith was knocked out of the game in the third quarter with a concussion, and Colt McCoy took over for the rest of the game. McCoy was 10-of-16 for 62 yards and two interceptions.</p>
<p>“I thought Derrick ran really well,” said Titans head coach Mike Vrabel. “I thought Dion came in and did some good things as well.”</p>
<p>The Titans will look to continue their winning ways next week when they travel to Indianapolis to take on the Colts.</p>
<h1 id="Tennessee-Titans-Defeat-Washington-Redskins-26-20"><a href="#Tennessee-Titans-Defeat-Washington-Redskins-26-20" class="headerlink" title="Tennessee Titans Defeat Washington Redskins, 26-20"></a>Tennessee Titans Defeat Washington Redskins, 26-20</h1><p>The Tennessee Titans are one of the NFL’s most surprising teams early in the 2018 season. The Titans entered Week 6 with a 3-2 record, and they extended that record with a 26-20 victory over the Washington Redskins on Sunday.</p>
<p>Quarterback Marcus Mariota led the way for the Titans, completing 20 of 29 passes for 218 yards and two touchdowns. He also had 37 rushing yards on eight carries.</p>
<p>Wide receiver Corey Davis was Mariota’s top target on Sunday, catching six passes for 82 yards and a touchdown. Tight end Jonnu Smith also had a strong game, catching four passes for 42 yards and a touchdown.</p>
<p>The Titans’ defense was solid once again, holding Washington to 328 total yards. Linebacker Wesley Woodyard led the way with nine tackles, while defensive end Brian Orakpo added two sacks.</p>
<p>The win keeps the Titans in playoff contention as they head into their bye week. They will return to action on October 21 when they host the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
